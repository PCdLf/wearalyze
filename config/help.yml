  Select a ZIP file here, recorded by the <strong>Empatica E4</strong><br>
  <br>
  Data must be in the standard format provided by Empatica.<br>
  A zip-file downloaded from Empatica contains several csv files that contain information on the physiological data that is recorded with the Empatica E4 
  <br?
  .csv files in this archive are in the following format:<br>
  The first row is the initial time of the session expressed as unix timestamp in UTC.<br>
  The second row is the sample rate expressed in Hz.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>TEMP.csv:</strong> Data from temperature sensor expressed degrees on the Celsius (°C) scale.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>EDA.csv:</strong> Data from the electrodermal activity sensor expressed as microsiemens (μS).<br>
  <br>
  <strong>BVP.csv:</strong> Data from photoplethysmograph.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>ACC.csv:</strong> Data from 3-axis accelerometer sensor.<br>
  The accelerometer is configured to measure acceleration in the range [-2g, 2g].<br>
  Therefore the unit in this file is 1/64g.<br>
  Data from x, y, and z axis are respectively in first, second, and third column.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>IBI.csv:</strong> Time between individuals heart beats extracted from the BVP signal.<br>
  No sample rate is needed for this file.<br>
  The first column is the time (respect to the initial time) of the detected inter-beat<br>
  interval expressed in seconds (s).
  The second column is the duration in seconds (s) of the detected inter-beat interval<br>
  (i.e., the distance in seconds from the previous beat).<br>
  <br>
  <strong>HR.csv:</strong> Average heart rate extracted from the BVP signal.
  <br>
  The first row is the initial time of the session expressed as unix timestamp in UTC. The second row is the sample rate expressed in Hz.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>tags.csv:</strong> Event mark times.<br>
  Each row corresponds to a physical button press on the device; the same time as the status LED is first illuminated. The time is expressed as a unix timestamp in UTC and it is synchronized with initial time of the session indicated in the related data files from the corresponding session.
  
calendar: >
  Select a calendar file here. A calendar is an XLSX/XLS/TXT file that contains a table with five columns.<br>
  The column names are used by the application, so make sure to name them accordingly, and also use the correct date and time format.<br>
  <br>
  1. <strong>Date:</strong> a day-month-year variable  ("dd-mm-yyyy" format). <br>
  2. <strong>Start:</strong> an hour:minute:seconds variable ("hh:mm:ss" format).<br>
  3. <strong>End:</strong> an hour:minute:seconds variable ("hh:mm:ss" format).<br>
  4. <strong>Text:</strong> Text variable that needs to be displayed in the graph.<br>
  4. <strong>Color:</strong> The color to be used for shading the graph. R colornames can be found here: www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf <br>
  <br>
  The start and end columns are used to shade the time duration periods in the graph.<br>

visualization: > 
  The Visualization tab has a Settings tab and a Plot tab (which is hidden).<br>
  <br>
  In the Settings tab the user can add a title to the plot and decide if the annotations should be displayed.<br> 
  <br>
  On the right side of the Settings tab, the user has the option to set the ranges of the graphs, and add mean values or custom values to be displayed.<br>
  <br>
  After the Settings tab has been set, the user can press the "Make Plot" button and view the Plot tab for the plots of the physiological signals.<br>
  <br>
  Note that the plots use an aggregated version of the physiological signals (5 minute aggregates) to speed up the visualization. 

analysis: >
  
  The user can select a time frame for which the features should be extracted. By default the entire recording period is selected. <br>
  The analysis will only be run on that specific time period and extracted features will appear in the box below.
  
report: >
  Create a report that contains the graph, the analysis and the calendar data. <br>
  The report is created as an HTML page.
  
batch: >
  Users can batch process large amounts of Empatica E4 files here and set parameters accordingly.
  
cut: >
  Cut your ZIP file into multiple files.\
