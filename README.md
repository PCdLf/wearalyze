# About

Wearalyze is a Shiny app that supports patients, clinicians and researchers in the analysis of data from commonly used wearables. It is designed to be transparent, fast and without any data storage. 

‚ö†Ô∏è Wearalyze is currently in development and not yet ready for use.

# Running the app

This app is a [Rhino](https://github.com/Appsilon/rhino) project ü¶è. Rhino makes use of [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html) to manage the project dependencies.

If you pull the project from GitHub, `renv` will automatically be downloaded and installed. Once that's done, you can run the following code to install the required `wearalyze` dependencies:

```r
renv::restore()
```

After that, you can run the app by executing the following code:

```r
runApp()
```

Or alternatively, you can head over to the app.R file and click the "Run App" button in RStudio. 

# For developers

Since this project is using `renv` to manage project dependencies, it is required to snapshot the project library after installing new packages. This can be done by running `renv::snapshot()` which will make changes to the `renv.lock` file. Make sure that the dependencies are recorded in the `dependencies.R` file!
