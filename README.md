# About

Wearalyze is a Shiny app that supports patients, clinicians and researchers in the analysis of data from commonly used wearables. It is designed to be transparent, fast and without any data storage. 

We currently support the following devices:
* Empatica E4
* Empatica Embrace Plus
* Nowatch

The data can conveniently be uploaded via the app and is processed in immediately. The app provides a variety of visualizations and metrics to analyze the data. The data is not stored on any server, but only processed locally from where you're running the app. We also don't use cookies or user analytics.

# Running the app

This app is a [Rhino](https://github.com/Appsilon/rhino) project ü¶è. Rhino makes use of [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html) to manage the project dependencies.

If you pull the project from GitHub, `renv` will automatically be downloaded and installed. 

If everything is ok, the output will look as follows:

```r
# Bootstrapping renv 1.0.2 ---------------------------------------------------
- Downloading renv ... OK
- Installing renv  ... OK

- Project '~/wearalyze' loaded. [renv 1.0.2]
- One or more packages recorded in the lockfile are not installed.
- Use `renv::status()` for more details.
```

Once that's done, you can run the following code to install the required `wearalyze` R dependencies:

```r
renv::restore()
```

R dependencies will be installed with `install.packages()`.

After that (this can take some time!), you can run the app by executing the following code:

```r
runApp()
```

Or alternatively, you can head over to the `app.R` file and click the "Run App" button in RStudio. 

# For developers

## Using renv

Since this project is using `renv` to manage project dependencies, it is required to snapshot the project library after installing new packages. This can be done by running `renv::snapshot()` which will make changes to the `renv.lock` file. 

Make sure that the dependencies are recorded in the `dependencies.R` file!
